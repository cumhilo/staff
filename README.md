<!-- old README.md version -->
Mainly this was the first project I did relatively "big", but I really think I can improve the code now, so here I am,
re-coding it., I thank [iAlexT](https://github.com/iAlexT) for the help and what he taught me,
also [Sintaxis](https://github.com/Solotory) for helping me to solve some issues & [Yusshu](https://github.com/yusshu)
for reviewing my code and telling me what was wrong, or could be improved.
