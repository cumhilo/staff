# Staff
----

Currently the plugin is under a re-code, for obvious reasons it doesn't work in production, in fact you won't be able to
compile the latest or previous versions due to dependency changes, anyway, the recode code can be found in the package
com.github.cumhilo.staff, I decided to use this repository and not archive it and create another one because in the past
I did that and lost my stars on github :(

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Staff plugin, was created for staff members, in which you can get several tools to facilitate your work.

mainly, it's a learning project, how to handle mongo / redis among other things, I
thank [iAlexT](https://github.com/iAlexT) for the help and what he taught me,
also [Sintaxis](https://github.com/Solotory) for helping me to solve some issues & [Yusshu](https://github.com/yusshu)
for reviewing my code and
telling me what was wrong, or could be improved.
